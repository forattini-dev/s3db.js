- If you're working on a complex topic, consider creating an example in `./examples` to demonstrate how to work with that domain.
- When creating examples, use the helper functions provided in `./examples/database.js`.
- Every time you make a significant change, remember to update te types in `./src/s3db.d.ts`.
- Do not edit those test files: `./tests/database.js` and `./tests/jest.setup.js`
- We are using ESM, so its a type=module project.
- Always use `import "dotenv/config"` to load environment variables to examples and one-shot script files.
- Always use `import { createClientForTest, createDatabaseForTest } from "./tests/utils.js";` to create a client and database for tests.
