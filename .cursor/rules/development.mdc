- Always use pnpm to manage dependencies.
- At the end of each sprint, run the full test suite using `pnpm run test:ai`. Always!
- We're using a MinIO container to simulate S3 behavior. You can view the logs with `docker compose logs minio --tail 30`
- Be proactive and results-oriented at all times.
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) is not required, but we expect at least 80% code coverage.
- This is critical code—do not create mocks. Always use a valid client.
- We’ve provided utility functions to help with database and client initialization.
- Always reflect on what each test is actually validating.
- Tests must be quick to run and easy to implement. No test file should take more than a few seconds to execute.
